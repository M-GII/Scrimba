# Scrimba Repository

This repository contains all of the projects, build-alongs, and exercises I created while completing my certifications on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). It includes both small JavaScript practice projects and larger React applications.

## Projects Worth Checking Out
Projects with their own **README.md** files are highlighted here. These are the ones I consider most complete and worth exploring. Each has details, features, and in most cases, a demo GIF.

### React Projects
- [**Quizzical**](Projects/React/Quizzical) – A trivia game with customizable settings (amount of questions, type, difficulty).  
- [**Tenzies**](Projects/React/Tenzies) – Dice game capstone project with win conditions and confetti animation.  
- [**Assembly: Endgame**](Projects/React/AssemblyEndgame) – A Wordle-style capstone project where wrong guesses “lose” programming languages until you’re stuck with Assembly. 
- [**Digital Business Card**](Projects/React/Digital-Business-Card) – A simple React app that displays personal info like a modern portfolio card.  
- [**Meme Generator**](Learning/React/Meme_Generator) – Fetches meme templates from an API and lets you overlay custom text.   
- [**Chef Claude**](Learning/React/Chef-Claude) – An AI-powered recipe generator using the Anthropic Claude API (local only, no live deployment yet).  

### JavaScript Projects
- [**Leads Tracker (Chrome Extension)**](Learning/JavaScript/Chrome%20Extension) – Save input URLs or your current tab; persists with localStorage.  
- [**Basketball Scoreboard**](Projects/JavaScript/Basketball%20Scoreboard) – Score tracker for Home/Guest teams with +1, +2, +3 buttons and reset.  
- [**Password Generator**](Projects/JavaScript/Password%20Generator) – Generate secure random passwords with adjustable length and copy-to-clipboard.  
- [**Unit Converter**](Projects/JavaScript/Unit%20Converter) – Convert between metric and imperial units for length, volume, and mass.  

## About
- Each project lives in its own folder under `Learning/` or `Projects/`.  
- Many include a `README.md` with details, features, and a demo GIF or link.  
- These projects were built following along with Scrimba’s **Learn JavaScript** and **Learn React** courses, as well as the capstone projects at the end of each section.  

## Note
- Some projects are deployed (React apps), and links/GIFs are included in their individual READMEs.
