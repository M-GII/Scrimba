rel="stylesheet" specifies the relationship: this file is a stylesheet.
href="styles.css" points to the location of the CSS file being linked.
 This line connects an external CSS file to the HTML page.
 rel defines the type of connection (it's a stylesheet for design),
 and href points to the file that contains the styling rules. -->
